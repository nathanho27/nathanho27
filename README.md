# Nathan Ho
Data Analyst • Data Scientist • Business Intelligence Analyst

Statistics & Data Science, UC Santa Barbara (2025)

Hi, I’m Nathan.

I work at the intersection of data analytics, engineering, and visualization, turning raw data into clear insights and practical solutions. My work spans building data pipelines, developing predictive models, and delivering interactive dashboards that tell meaningful stories.

I enjoy projects involving sports analytics, financial markets, business intelligence, and large-scale data exploration. I’m especially focused on developing end-to-end workflows that connect data collection, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

Right now, I’m building projects using **Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel**, with an emphasis on actionable insights and clean, intuitive design.

I’m pursuing full-time opportunities where I can contribute to impactful data work and continue growing as an analyst and engineer.

## Featured Projects

**Yelp Business Intelligence (Python, PostgreSQL, Power BI)**  

End-to-end analytics project focused on market competitiveness, pricing trends, customer ratings, and location-based insights using the Yelp Fusion API, Power BI dashboards, and structured business reporting.

**Crypto Market Analytics Dashboard (Python, SQLite, Tableau)**

Developed a full analytics workflow integrating Python, SQLite, and Tableau to visualize and analyze crypto performance. Built a pipeline that ingests historical BTC/ETH price data into a structured SQL database, computes performance and risk KPIs (Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, correlation, volatility regime), and feeds into an interactive Tableau dashboard for exploration.

**Oregon Voter Analysis (Python, Databricks, SQL)**  
Processed 3M voter records in Databricks using PySpark and SQL. Built models to predict turnout and visualize demographic trends.

**NVIDIA Stock Forecasting (R)**  
Applied ARIMA and GARCH models in R to analyze stock volatility and identify risk patterns.

**NBA Breakout Predictor (R)**  
Built Random Forest and XGBoost models in R to classify “breakout” NBA seasons based on performance deltas across years.

## Projects in Progress

**Cross-Platform Music Listening Analytics (Python, SQLite, Power BI)**

A user behavior analytics project that integrates and normalizes listening data from Spotify and Apple Music into a unified engagement model. The project focuses on summarizing year-long media consumption patterns through platform-agnostic KPIs, including listening intensity, consistency, preference diversity, and discovery behavior. Insights are delivered through a narrative-style Power BI dashboard inspired by consumer product analytics, emphasizing clear storytelling and interpretable behavioral insights.

**MLB Player Trajectory Modeling (Python, MySQL, Power BI)**

An analytics project exploring how Major League Baseball players transition across performance states over time using Statcast tracking data. The focus is on identifying breakout, bounceback, decline, and stable profiles by modeling future OPS+ from prior-season underlying metrics. Model outputs are translated into an interactive Power BI dashboard for player ranking, interpretation, and longitudinal performance analysis.

**Fitness KPI Analytics (Python, Tableau) (Planned in the Future)**

A personal health analytics project created for my friends and me to track our fitness journeys using real data, rather than generic apps. Logs daily inputs such as calories, protein, workouts, cardio, sleep, and energy, and converts them into weekly KPIs and insights to measure consistency, understand behavior patterns, and support progress together. Built to help us stay accountable, improve our routines, and visualize long-term results through data modeling and BI dashboards.
