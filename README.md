# Nathan Ho
Aspiring Data Analyst • Data Scientist • Data Engineer  
Statistics & Data Science, UC Santa Barbara (2025)

Hi, I’m Nathan.

I work at the intersection of data analytics, engineering, and visualization, turning raw data into clear insights and practical solutions. My work spans building data pipelines, developing predictive models, and delivering interactive dashboards that tell meaningful stories.

I enjoy projects involving sports analytics, financial markets, business intelligence, and large-scale data exploration. I’m especially focused on developing end-to-end workflows that connect data collection, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

Right now, I’m building projects using **Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel**, with an emphasis on actionable insights and clean, intuitive design.

I’m pursuing full-time opportunities where I can contribute to impactful data work and continue growing as an analyst and engineer.

## Featured Projects

**Yelp Business Intelligence (Power BI)**  

End-to-end analytics project focused on market competitiveness, pricing trends, customer ratings, and location-based insights using the Yelp Fusion API, Power BI dashboards, and structured business reporting.

**Crypto Market Analytics Dashboard**

Developed a full analytics workflow integrating Python, SQLite, and Tableau to visualize and analyze crypto performance. Built a pipeline that ingests historical BTC/ETH price data into a structured SQL database, computes performance and risk KPIs (Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, correlation, volatility regime), and feeds into an interactive Tableau dashboard for exploration.

**NBA Stats Analytics**  
Extracts and analyzes NBA player and game data using the NBA API. Visualizes trends through Tableau dashboards and data storytelling.

**Oregon Voter Analysis**  
Processed 3M voter records in Databricks using PySpark and SQL. Built models to predict turnout and visualize demographic trends.

**NVIDIA Stock Forecasting**  
Applied ARIMA and GARCH models in R to analyze stock volatility and identify risk patterns.

**NBA Breakout Predictor**  
Built Random Forest and XGBoost models in R to classify “breakout” NBA seasons based on performance deltas across years.

## Projects in Progress

**MLB Player Trajectory Modeling (Power BI)**

After finishing my current project (Yelp BI), I plan to explore player performance trajectories in Major League Baseball using Statcast data. The focus is on identifying breakout, bounceback, decline, and stable profiles by predicting future OPS+ from prior-season tracking metrics. Model outputs are then translated into an interactive Power BI dashboard for ranking, interpretation, and analysis.

**Fitness KPI Analytics**

A personal health analytics project created for my friends and me to track our fitness journeys using real data, rather than generic apps. Logs daily inputs such as calories, protein, workouts, cardio, sleep, and energy, and converts them into weekly KPIs and insights to measure consistency, understand behavior patterns, and support progress together. Built to help us stay accountable, improve our routines, and visualize long-term results through data modeling and BI dashboards.
