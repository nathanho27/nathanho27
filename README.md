# Nathan Ho

Hi, I’m Nathan — an aspiring Data Analyst with a background in Statistics and Data Science from UC Santa Barbara.  
I enjoy exploring data from different angles — cleaning, modeling, and visualizing insights that help tell a story.  
My work focuses on turning raw data into something clear, visual, and useful.
